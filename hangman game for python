here u can find a simple python code for hangman game! (feel free to use it!)   

import random

# List of words for the game
words = ["python", "hangman", "programming", "computer", "algorithm", "software", "developer"]

# Select a random word from the list
word = random.choice(words)

# Initialize variables
guesses = ""
max_attempts = 6  # Maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed
attempts = 0

# Display initial message
print("Welcome to Hangman!")

# Main game loop
while True:
    # Display the current progress (underscores for unrevealed letters)
    display_word = ""
    for letter in word:
        if letter in guesses:
            display_word += letter
        else:
            display_word += "_"

    print("Word:", display_word)

    # Ask the player for a guess
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

    # Check if the guess is a single letter
    if len(guess) != 1 or not guess.isalpha():
        print("Please enter a single letter.")
        continue

    # Check if the guess has already been guessed
    if guess in guesses:
        print("You already guessed that letter.")
        continue

    # Add the guess to the list of guesses
    guesses += guess

    # Check if the guess is correct
    if guess in word:
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect!")
        attempts += 1

    # Check if the player has won or lost
    if set(word) == set(guesses):
        print("Congratulations! You guessed the word:", word)
        break
    elif attempts >= max_attempts:
        print("Sorry, you're out of attempts. The word was:", word)
        break
